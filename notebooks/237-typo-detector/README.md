# Convert and Optimize Typo  Detector with OpenVINOâ„¢

Typo detection in AI is a process of identifying and correcting typographical errors in text data using machine learning algorithms. The goal of typo detection is to improve the accuracy, readability, and usability of text by identifying and correcting mistakes made during the writing process.

A typo detector takes a sentence as an input and identify all typographical errors such as misspellings and homophone errors.

This tutorial provides how to use the [Typo Detector](https://huggingface.co/m3hrdadfi/typo-detector-distilbert-en) from the [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) library to perform the above task.

The model has been pretrained on the [NeuSpell](https://github.com/neuspell/neuspell) dataset.
