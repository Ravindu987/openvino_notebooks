    "# Typo Detector with OpenVino\n",
    "\n",
    "Typo detection in AI is a process of identifying and correcting typographical errors in text data using machine learning algorithms. The goal of typo detection is to improve the accuracy, readability, and usability of text by identifying and correcting mistakes made during the writing process.\n",
    "\n",
    "A typo detector takes a sentence as an input and identify all typographical errors such as misspellings and homophone errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial provides how to use the [Typo Detector](https://huggingface.co/m3hrdadfi/typo-detector-distilbert-en) from the [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) library to perform the above task."

    "There are two methods to use the typo detection model with OpenVino. In this tutorial we will look at both.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1. Using the [Hugging Face Optimum](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/index) library\n",
    "The Hugging Face Optimum API is a high-level API that allows us to convert and quantize models from the Hugging Face Transformers library to the OpenVINOâ„¢ IR format.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. Converting the model to ONNX and then to OpenVino IR\n",
    "First the Pytorch model is convereted to the ONNX format and then the [Model Optimizer](https://docs.openvino.ai/latest/openvino_docs_MO_DG_Deep_Learning_Model_Optimizer_DevGuide.html) tool will be used to convert to Openvino IR format."

    "## Hugging Face Optimum library\n",
    "\n",
    "For this method, we need to install the Hugging Face Optimum library accelerated by OpenVINO integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimum Intel can be used to load optimized models from the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/intel/hf.co/models) and create pipelines to run an inference with OpenVINO Runtime using Hugging Face APIs. The Optimum Inference models are API compatible with Hugging Face Transformers models.  This means we need just replace AutoModelForXxx class with the corresponding OVModelForXxx class."

It involves cleaning the data and assigning tokens or IDs to the words, so they are represented in a vector space where similar words have similar vectors.
